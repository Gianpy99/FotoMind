**Project Name:** FotoMind AI  
**Owner:** Solo build (you)  
**Date:** 2025-08-14  

---

## 1. Problem Statement
Photos often hold hidden patterns, memories, and meanings that are not immediately visible. While existing photo apps focus on editing and sharing, very few aim to analyze and interpret images in a way that combines **visual recognition** with **emotional and contextual insights**.

**FotoMind AI** will be an **AI-powered photo analysis and insight generator** that goes beyond filters and edits — extracting themes, emotions, object detection, memory links, and potential creative uses from a user’s image library.

---

## 2. Goals & Objectives
- **Analyze** user photos for objects, faces, locations, and moods.  
- **Generate** meaningful captions, tags, and stories for each image.  
- **Discover** connections between images (same people, locations, themes).  
- **Enable** memory retrieval through natural language queries (“Show me pictures of last summer at the beach”).  
- **Respect** user privacy with on-device or self-hosted processing options.

---

## 3. Target Users
- **Primary:** Individuals wanting deeper insights from personal or family photo collections.  
- **Secondary:** Amateur photographers looking for inspiration and organization.  
- **Tertiary:** Creative professionals who want quick idea generation from visual content.

## 4. Core Features
### MVP
1. **Image Recognition** for people, objects, locations.  
2. **Mood Detection** using color and facial expression analysis.  
3. **Smart Tagging & Captioning** powered by AI models.  
4. **Search by Natural Language** (“Find photos with mountains and friends smiling”).  

### Phase 2
5. **Timeline View** with clustering by events.  
6. **Connection Mapping** between people, objects, and places.  
7. **Offline Mode** with local AI inference.

### Phase 3
8. **Creative Mode** for generating story ideas or art prompts from photo sets.  
9. **Integration with cloud services** (Google Photos, iCloud, Dropbox).  
10. **Custom AI Models** trained on personal photo style.

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Privacy:** All image analysis should be user-controlled, with a strong focus on local or private-cloud processing.  
- **Performance:** Process a batch of 100 photos under 2 minutes on desktop hardware.  
- **Portability:** Work on Windows, macOS, and Linux.  

---

## 6. Constraints
- Large models may require GPU acceleration for real-time performance.  
- Initial model size may be >1GB, requiring optional model downloads.

---

## 7. Tech Stack Suggestion
- **Backend AI:** Python (PyTorch, OpenCV, CLIP, BLIP-2).  
- **Frontend:** Electron.js or Tauri for cross-platform app.  
- **Database:** SQLite or PostgreSQL for metadata storage.  
- **Optional Cloud Sync:** Supabase or Firebase.

---

## 8. Success Metrics
- MVP should correctly tag at least 85% of test images.  
- Natural language search returns correct matches 90% of the time.  
- Batch processing speed <2s per image.

---

## 9. Roadmap
| Phase     | Duration  | Key Deliverables |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| **MVP**   | 6 weeks   | Image recognition, mood detection, tagging, NL search |
| **Phase 2** | +4 weeks | Timeline view, connection mapping, offline mode |
| **Phase 3** | +6 weeks | Creative mode, cloud integrations, custom AI models |

---

## 10. Risks & Mitigation
- **Model bias** → Train/fine-tune with diverse datasets.  
- **Privacy concerns** → Offer offline-only mode.  
- **Performance issues** → Support model quantization for speed.

---

## 11. Open Questions
- Should MVP include **face recognition** or only **face detection**?  
- Should creative mode integrate **text-to-image** models for inspiration?
