# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**Project Name:** FotoMind AI  
**Owner:** Solo build (you)  
**Date:** 2025-08-14

## 1) Problem Statement
Users often struggle to turn creative ideas into visually compelling images without advanced design skills or expensive software. Existing AI image generators may produce generic results or require complex prompts. There is a need for a user-friendly platform that translates text concepts, mood, and style preferences into high-quality images — suitable for personal, professional, or educational use.

---

## 2) Goals & Objectives
- **Enable users to generate images from text prompts** with control over style, colors, and composition.  
- **Provide AI-assisted enhancement tools** for refining generated images.  
- **Support multiple output formats** (JPEG, PNG, transparent background).  
- **Offer a simple interface** that reduces cognitive load while encouraging creativity.  
- **Allow users to build and save image libraries** for ongoing projects.

---

## 3) Target Users
- **Primary:** Creatives, designers, and hobbyists seeking quick visual content.  
- **Secondary:** Educators or students needing illustrative assets.  
- **Tertiary:** Social media content creators, marketers, and small businesses.

## 4) Core Features

### MVP
1. **Text-to-Image Generation** using pre-trained AI models.  
2. **Style Selection** (Realistic, Cartoon, Minimalist, Fantasy, etc.).  
3. **Resolution Control** for output images.  
4. **Basic Editing Tools** (crop, rotate, adjust brightness/contrast).  
5. **Save & Export** images locally or in cloud storage.  
6. **Preview Functionality** to view multiple variations before finalizing.

### Phase 2
7. **Batch Generation** for multiple images from a single prompt.  
8. **Prompt Suggestions** using AI for enhanced creativity.  
9. **Custom Styles & Filters** saved by the user for consistent branding.  

### Phase 3
10. **Collaborative Projects** allowing multiple users to work on the same library.  
11. **Integration with Design Tools** (Figma, Canva, Adobe Creative Cloud).  
12. **Advanced AI Editing**: inpainting, background replacement, and style transfer.

---

## 5) Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Generate previews in < 5 seconds for standard resolution; full images in < 15 seconds.  
- **Reliability:** Server uptime ≥ 99.5%; queue system for high demand periods.  
- **Security:** Ensure no data leakage; user images remain private unless explicitly shared.  
- **Accessibility:** Web interface compatible with screen readers; mobile responsive.

---

## 6) Constraints
- AI models may require GPU for high-resolution generation; local deployment might be limited.  
- Free-tier users may have limitations on number of generations per day.  
- Large-scale cloud-based generation requires cost management to avoid overspending.

---

## 7) Tech Stack Suggestion
- **Frontend:** React with Tailwind CSS or SvelteKit.  
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI) with AI inference orchestration.  
- **AI Models:** Stable Diffusion, DALL·E API, or open-source alternatives.  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing user libraries and settings.  
- **Cloud/Compute:** GPU-enabled cloud service (AWS, GCP, or local NVIDIA RTX).  
- **Storage:** S3 or equivalent for image assets.

---

## 8) Success Metrics
- **User Engagement:** ≥ 60% of users generate more than 5 images per session.  
- **Retention:** ≥ 40% returning weekly.  
- **Generation Quality:** ≥ 80% of users rate images as meeting expectations.  
- **Growth:** Word-of-mouth and social sharing lead to organic user acquisition.

## 9) Roadmap

| Phase     | Duration  | Key Deliverables |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| **MVP**   | 6 weeks   | Text-to-image generation, style selection, basic editing, save/export |
| **Phase 2** | +4 weeks | Batch generation, prompt suggestions, custom styles |
| **Phase 3** | +6 weeks | Collaboration, advanced editing, design tool integrations |

---

## 10) Risks & Mitigation
- **Model Bias / Inappropriate Outputs:** Implement content filtering and moderation.  
- **High Compute Costs:** Introduce tiered access; optimize model efficiency.  
- **User Frustration with Prompts:** Provide AI-assisted prompt suggestions.  
- **Copyright Concerns:** Ensure models are trained on legally permissible datasets; notify users of usage rights.

---

## 11) Open Questions
- Should the platform allow **commercial usage** of generated images by default?  
- How many **predefined styles** should MVP include?  
- Should we provide **mobile app** version from the start or web-first only?
